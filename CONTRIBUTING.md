Create an iPython Notebook with the proposed model. Create [PR](https://github.com/avinashshenoy97/myquity/compare) and clearly state what model was used with what dataset (and where it was obtained from). Maybe explain why you think that model should work well.

In addition to the `ipynb`, add plots to the `plots` folder, after creating a subdirectory named after the proposed model. The plots should be named in a similar fashion to existing models.

Add a README under the new subdirectory in the plots folder and link to it from the README in the root directory of the repository.
